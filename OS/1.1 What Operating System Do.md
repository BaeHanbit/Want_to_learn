# What Operating Systems Do

## Four Component of Computer System
1. Hardware
- Those hardware components provide thr basic computing resources for the system
    1. Central Processing Unit(CPU)
    2. Memory
    3. Input/Output devices
2. Operating System
- Controls the hardware and coordinate its use among the various application programs
3. Application Program
- Such as Word Processors, Spreadsheets, Compilers, and Web Browsers are kind of Application programs
- Application program define how to use resouces without asking users 
4. User

## Another way of view
1. We can also view a computer system as consisting of hardware, software, and data.
2. Operating System provides the proper use of resources in the computer system.
3. Just like a goverment, operating system never perform useless function.
4. Operating system provides the best environment how other programs can work usefully.

## User view
- The Computer of User's view have varied according to the interface being uesd.
### Personal PC
1. Computer users sit in front of a PC which is consistig of monitor, keybord, mouse, and system unit.
2. It is designed for **one user** to monopolize all of its resources.
3. Mostly, the operating system is designed for ease of use, rather than for roesouce utilization.
### Pulbic PC
1. Users sit at a terminal which is connected to mainframe or minicomputer
2. They all shared resources and may exchange information.
3. In this case, the operating system is designed to maximize resource utilization and, control that no individual user takes more than his fair share.
### Client, Server PC
1. Users sit at workstation connected to networks of other workstations and server.
2. Users devote resources, but get shared resources.
3. Designed to compromise between individual usability and resource utilization.
### Embaded PC
1. It have little or no view.
2. EMbaded PC and thier operating system are not designed for user view bur to run without user intervention.

## System view
- As computer's point of view, the operating system is the program which is the most imtimately involved with the hardware.
### Resource allocator
1. The operating system acts as the manager of hardware resources
    - CPU time
    - Memory space
    - File-storage space
    - I/O devices
2. Operating system must decide how to allocate resources fairly among numerous and possibly conflicting requests.
### Control program
1. Operating system is control porgram which need to manage the execution of user programs prevent errors and improper use of the computer.
2. Operating system emphasizes the need to control the various I/O devices and user programs.

## Defining operating system
### History
1. Computer started as an experiment to determine what could be done, and quickly moved to fix-purpose systems for military uses.
2. Those early computers evolved in to general-purpose.
3. Just like the Moore's Law(The number of transistors on an integrated circuit would be double every eighteen months), computer have gained functionality and shrunk in size.
### Define
1. The fundamental goal of computer system is to execute user programs and to make solving user problem easier.
2. Because, bare hardware is too hard to use, application programs have been developed.
3. Operating system afford controlling and allocating resources as one piece of **software**
> Operating system is the one program running all times on the computer, usually called kernel
